## üß© Components Used

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| ESP32 or Arduino UNO | Main controller (with Wi-Fi capability) |
| MQ-2 Sensor | Detects gases like LPG, CO, Methane |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Working Principle

1. Sensors (MQ-2 and DHT11) continuously monitor gas, temperature, and humidity levels.  
2. ESP32 displays live readings on OLED and checks for dangerous thresholds.  
3. When gas levels exceed the safe limit:  
   - Buzzer and LED turn ON  
   - Warning message displayed on OLED  
4. Data can be sent to a Python AI or ML model for advanced prediction and trend analysis.

## üß† AI and ML Integration

- Machine learning models such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM are used for intelligent gas risk classification.  
- ML model predicts whether the environment is **Safe**, **Moderate**, or **Dangerous**. 
- Can be integrated with TinyML or cloud systems for real-time predictions.
